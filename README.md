Formatters
==========

This site, is now and probably will be indefinately, under construction.


This repo contains two full stack Java apps, an Sql formatter and an Xml formatter.  You can use either of the two links below to see them in action as they each have pointers to the other.  They are hosted on Google's appengine.

* The Sql formatter currently formats most of the common SQL commands and some functions, they are listed in the tools.java.pats.nodes package.  I've used W3Schools as a guide for the common commands.  This is a work in process, I'm adding functions, corrections and refactoring when I get the time.  You can use some of the test sql scripts in the SqlTestData folder to test drive the app.

* The Xml formatter was in response to errors I would get when cutting SOAP messages from logs and trying to run them in SoapUI.  It's a simple solution, replace all white space occurances with one space each and pretty print the result.  SoapUI is happy with this approach.


There are a couple other HTML/JS apps you can play with if you like in the webapp folder, a MathTutor and a Weight and balance page for the Robinson R-44.  They are JQuery apps and I'm currently (slowly) converting the MathTutor to an Angular.js app.
